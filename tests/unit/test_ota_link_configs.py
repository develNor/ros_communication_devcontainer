"""The OTA templates a session gets when it only names a middleware.

`shared.rmw` is meant to be an interchangeable choice: a session says `cyclone`
or `fastdds` and gets a configuration that survives a cellular tunnel either
way. That promise lives in two places — the default template per implementation
and what those templates actually set — and neither is visible from a session
definition, so it is pinned here.

The fragment cap is the one that decides whether a link works at all. Left at
its default, Fast DDS hands a 38 kB camera keyframe to the kernel as one
datagram and the peer has to reassemble ~27 IP fragments as a unit; Cyclone has
always sent 1200 B RTPS fragments here. Both templates must agree.
