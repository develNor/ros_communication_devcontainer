"""The stage-ownership rule in `terminology.md` §9.1, against the code.

The rule is normative — it decides what may be added to this project — and it
argues from concrete pairs: decompression undoes compression, the unwrapper
undoes the wrapper, `global_to_local` undoes `local_to_global`, `trickle`
undoes `latch`, and the playout pacer compensates for the medium. A rule that
reasons from examples is only as good as the examples, and a renamed node
leaves it quietly arguing from things that are not there any more.

This is a documentation test, not a behaviour test: there is no behaviour to
run. What it pins is that every node the rule names still exists, that the two
tests it offers still name assertions the session schema accepts, and that the
section it belongs to is still where §7 sends the reader.
