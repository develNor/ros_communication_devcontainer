# Neither A Queue Nor A Burst Tilts The Size Law

## Claim

The field fit of `1-(1-p)^N` carries a residual that is systematic in size: the
smallest class loses about half of what the fit predicts and the largest about
2.9× more, a spread of roughly six across the ladder. Three candidate causes
were emulated against the same measurement chain, and none of them produces it.

| | 300 B | 1.1 kB | 3.1 kB | 6.1 kB | 12.1 kB | 38.1 kB |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| independent per packet | 1.05 % | 1.47 % | 3.47 % | 6.28 % | 11.23 % | 31.92 % |
| a two-state process, same mean, 105 ms bad runs | 1.47 % | 1.76 % | 2.76 % | 5.09 % | 10.00 % | **21.98 %** |
| + a token bucket a burst can fill (4 Mbit/s) | 1.14 % | 1.33 % | 2.57 % | 4.99 % | 13.43 % | 32.92 % |
| a serialisation constraint (1.5 Mbit/s) | — | 1.62 % | — | — | 11.60 % | **97.54 %** |

- **The chain is not the cause.** Under independent per-packet loss the fitted
  law is reproduced with residuals of 1.20, 0.85, 1.01, 1.06, 0.97 and 1.00 —
  flat over three decades of size. Whatever tilts the field, it is not the
  wrapper, the join, or the way the fit is taken.
- **Clustered loss is not the cause, and it bends the curve the other way.**
  A two-state process at the same 1 % mean, with its chain rescaled per cell so
  that a bad run is the same 105 ms of wall clock in every one of them, makes
  the largest class lose **31 % less** than the independent law rather than
  more: 21.98 % against 31.92 %, intervals 20.3–23.8 against 30.0–33.9. The
  reason is the one that makes it a mechanism rather than a coincidence — a
  38-packet message occupies about the length of one bad run, so its packets
  share a fate and the message is lost once instead of thirty-eight times
  independently. The field's residual has the opposite sign, so burstiness at
  this scale does not explain it; it makes it harder to explain.
- **A burst meeting a queue is not the cause.** A token bucket at 4 Mbit/s —
  above the largest class's mean offered rate of 3.0 Mbit/s and far below its
  instantaneous one, so a 38-packet message meets a queue and a 1-packet
  message does not — changes nothing systematic: 1.09, 0.90, 0.74, 0.80, 1.20,
  1.03 against the unqueued arm. The queue defers rather than drops, which is
  the same statement as
  [oversubscription queues, it does not lose](oversubscription-queues-not-losses.md),
  seen per size.
- **A serialisation constraint does not tilt it either — it removes the class.**
  At 1.5 Mbit/s the one-packet message pays 10 % more than unshaped and the
  13-packet message 3 % more, while the 38-packet message goes from 31.9 % to
  **97.5 %**. That is not a slope, it is a threshold: below the constraint
  nothing changes, above it the stream is gone.

The last row is worth naming for what it is *shaped* like. A link whose
transmission opportunities are a fraction of the wall clock presents from above
as exactly this — a small probe crossing unharmed while a large burst does not
— which is the signature an uplink moved onto a duty-cycled carrier would leave
in an application's own numbers. This reproduces the signature; it does not
demonstrate the mechanism, because a sustained rate cap and a duty cycle are
not the same thing and this cell is oversubscribed on the mean as well as on
the burst.

## Setup

- Host pair / topology: one host, the packaged local benchmark rig — two
  communication containers on their own Docker network, `tc` inside each
  container's own netns (`--sudo-mode container`).
- Session: `bench_1_1_capacity` from the packaged example project, one
  `a->b:/bench_capacity` stream at 10 Hz, CycloneDDS, OTA QoS best_effort /
  KEEP_LAST depth 1.
- rosotacom SHA: measured at `7bb420c`; needs 2.5.dev74 or later for the fitted
  delay table to arm at all.
- Profiles: `tilt-iid`, `tilt-iid-queued` and `tilt-iid-tight` in
  [`src/rosotacom/resources/examples/profiles.yaml`](../../src/rosotacom/resources/examples/profiles.yaml).
  All three carry the 2026-08-17 drive's own delay table at 25 ms ± 18 ms and
  1 % independent per-packet loss; they differ only in the rate cap in front of
  it — none, 4 Mbit/s, 1.5 Mbit/s.
- Seed policy: netem `loss` is unseeded, `n=1` per cell, about 2100 messages
  inside the measured window of each.

## Evidence

Evidence grade: per-message counts from the receiving peer's own RFC 0003
transit records, windowed in sequence numbers (first 300 and last 50 dropped)
so that the unshaped messages before the shaper is armed leave both the
delivered and the lost class at once.

The independent arm, with one `(p, F)` fitted by maximum likelihood over the
whole ladder (`p = 0.870 %` per packet, `F = 872 B`):

| wrapped | N | offered | lost | observed | 95 % CI | obs/pred |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 300 B | 1 | 2101 | 22 | 1.047 % | 0.69–1.58 | 1.20 |
| 1.1 kB | 2 | 2102 | 31 | 1.475 % | 1.04–2.09 | 0.85 |
| 3.1 kB | 4 | 2105 | 73 | 3.468 % | 2.77–4.34 | 1.01 |
| 6.1 kB | 7 | 2103 | 132 | 6.277 % | 5.32–7.40 | 1.06 |
| 12.1 kB | 14 | 2102 | 236 | 11.227 % | 9.95–12.65 | 0.97 |
| 38.1 kB | 44 | 2102 | 671 | 31.922 % | 29.96–33.95 | 1.00 |

The queued arm on the same ladder: 24, 28, 54, 105, 283 and 693 losses of about
2100 offered, giving the second row of the claim table. The tight arm: 34 of
2104, 244 of 2103, and 1826 of 1872.

**Measuring the two-state arm took two attempts, and the reason is worth
recording.** `netem`'s Gilbert–Elliott model advances its chain once per
*packet*, not once per second, so a size ladder at a fixed message rate runs the
chain at a different speed in every cell — 10 packets/s for a one-fragment
message against 380 for a 38-fragment one. The cells then do not share a loss
process. The arm measured that way duly reported a per-packet mean of 0.33 % in
its smallest cell against a stationary 1.00 %, because that cell never sampled
enough of the chain.

Holding the offered *packet* rate constant instead was the obvious fix and it
measured something else entirely: **the pipeline serves messages, not packets.**
At 60 messages/s the one-packet cell lost 10.774 % under the bursty profile and
10.626 % under the independent one, and at 380 messages/s 48.391 % and 48.430 %.
Two different loss processes cannot agree to three digits; what both were
reporting is the depth-1 OTA queue overwriting its own backlog before the link
sees it — the same mechanism as
[depth-1 overwrite](depth1-overwrite-bundled-publications.md), reached by
accident.

What works is to leave the message rate at the field's 10 Hz and rescale the
chain: multiplying `p` and `r` by `380/(N × 10)` in each cell leaves the
stationary bad fraction at 3.92 % and the mean loss at 1 % while making the bad
run 105 ms of wall clock everywhere, which is the drive's own figure. The six
`bp-frag-*` profiles are that ladder.

Verification: manual, from a source checkout with Docker:

```bash
for prof in tilt-iid tilt-iid-queued; do
  for size in 200 1000 3000 6000 12000 38000; do
    rosotacom benchmark probe \
      --project src/rosotacom/resources/examples/rosotacom.yaml \
      --profile "$prof" --size "$size" --rate-hz 10 --duration 240 \
      --repeats 1 --sudo-mode container --no-plot
  done
done
rosotacom benchmark probe --project src/rosotacom/resources/examples/rosotacom.yaml \
  --profile tilt-iid-tight --size 38000 --rate-hz 10 --duration 240 \
  --repeats 1 --sudo-mode container --no-plot
```

```bash
for pair in 200:one 1000:two 3000:four 6000:six 12000:twelve 38000:thirtyeight; do
  rosotacom benchmark probe \
    --project src/rosotacom/resources/examples/rosotacom.yaml \
    --profile "bp-frag-${pair##*:}" --size "${pair%%:*}" --rate-hz 10 \
    --duration 240 --repeats 1 --sudo-mode container --no-plot
done
```

The independent ladder must fit one `(p, F)` to within about ten per cent at
every point; the queued ladder must not differ from it systematically; the
rescaled two-state ladder must fall below it at the large end and not above; and
the tight cell at 38 kB must be near-total loss while its 1 kB cell is not.

## Publication notes

This is a set of negative results and the negative is the point: a residual
that survives three plausible explanations is worth more than one that has not
been attacked. What it licenses is a narrower claim than "we do not know why" —
the tilt is not an artefact of the accounting, it is not what a queue does to a
burst, and it is not a serialisation limit, because a serialisation limit does
not tilt a curve, it truncates it.

The clustered arm is the one that changes the reading rather than confirming
it. A reviewer's first guess for a size-systematic residual is burstiness, and
burstiness at the drive's own time scale produces the **opposite sign**: it
protects large messages, because a message long enough to span a bad run is lost
once rather than in each of its packets. So the field's residual is not
explained by the mechanism that the field's own two-layer model already
contains, which is worth saying out loud.

What is left to attack is correlation at a scale *shorter* than a large
message's own time on the wire — short enough that a message straddles a loss
event more often than a single packet does, without its packets sharing one.
`netem` cannot express that at all: its chain advances per packet, so a run is
always measured in packets rather than in milliseconds, and the two coincide
only at one message size.

The serialisation row deserves one sentence wherever a duty-cycled uplink is
discussed. It shows that the observable signature of such a link — small
messages unaffected, large messages gone, round-trip time unchanged — is
reproducible from a rate constraint alone, which means the signature on its own
does not identify the mechanism.
