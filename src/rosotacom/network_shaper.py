"""RFC 0004 — fail-safe profile arming on a real OTA interface (privileged half).

The pure schema/argv lives in :mod:`rosotacom.network_profiles`; this is the
controller that *arms* those commands on a live interface with the hard fail-safe
RFC 0004 demands — the highest-risk item, because a stuck ``qdisc`` silently
corrupts every later result on the machine:

* **revert on stop and on error** (a context manager that tears down on normal exit
  *and* on an exception, without suppressing it);
* a **detached safety watchdog** that reverts after a max duration even if the
  orchestrator crashes mid-run;
* an **idempotent teardown** that always runs (clears the root qdisc and brings the
  link back up, tolerating a missing qdisc / already-up link);
* a **refusal to shape the SSH/control interface** — shaping it would cut the very
  orchestration applying the profile.

Command execution is injected (a ``CommandRunner``), so the guard, the arm/teardown
ordering and the revert-on-exception are all host-testable with a fake runner; the
live adapter merely runs the argv over SSH/subprocess.
