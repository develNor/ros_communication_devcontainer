"""Collection rules for the Docker-backed e2e suite, and the CI slice partition.

`just test-e2e-smoke` runs the whole suite in one process; CI runs the same
collection as seventeen parallel slices, selected with `--e2e-slice=<name>`. A
slice is a deselection of one shared collection, not a separate pytest
invocation with its own file list — which is what it used to be, and that shape
got two things wrong that a partition cannot get wrong:

- `-k "remote_assist"` missed the `[remote-assist-anonymized-*]` parameters,
  because the parameter id spells it with hyphens (#198 found and fixed that);
- `-k "remote_assist"` and `-k "anonymized"` both matched
  `test_local_remote_assist_anonymized_smoke_from_copied_example_project`, so
  the gate ran that test in two slices every run (#226). The contract test
  compared a *union* of the slices against the monolith, and a union hides an
  overlap.

The number next to each test is what it costs. #226 balanced six themed slices
on those numbers and the run came back within 25s of every prediction, so #235
used the same model to choose N instead of guessing it. #253 makes diagnosis
the stronger constraint: costs decide when a theme needs another runner, but
unrelated tests are never packed together merely because their durations fit.
Seventeen is the smallest theme-preserving partition that reaches the floor.

#: Seconds a job spends outside the tests: checkout, Python, `just setup`,
#: `docker info`, plus pytest's own setup and teardown phases.
#:
#: 46.0 as `job wall − Σ call` over the thirteen e2e jobs of run 31687149587,
#: median 45.3s, mean 49.3s. It was 55.0, measured the same way on runs
#: 31597657446 and 31634604888; #248 then replaced `apt-get update &&
#: apt-get install -y just` with a pinned release binary, which is most of the
#: difference.
RUNNER_SETUP_SECONDS = 46.0

#: Seconds the first test in a job pays to get the rosotacom project image.
#: Every job pays it exactly once, whichever test runs first, so it is a
#: constant no partition can remove. Because it is per job and not per test, it
#: is also what makes more slices cost more.
#:
#: It was 154.0 — a `docker build`, measured over 21 cold/warm pairs across
#: seven runs (median 153.7s). #236 replaced that build with a pull of a
#: content-addressed image the merge gate's `image` job publishes, and this is
#: what the pull costs instead. So the number models the *merge gate*: the
#: release and nightly lanes still build from scratch, deliberately, as the
#: check that a published image and a fresh build still agree.
#:
#: 70.0 was that pull with a `desktop-full` base. #245 rebased the image on
#: `ros-base`, taking the published project image from 1640 MB to 957 MB, and a
#: pull costs what it moves.
#:
#: 33.0 from three estimators on runs 31681061779 (before) and 31687149587
#: (after), which ran the same partition on either side of #245. The paired
#: difference is the cleanest of them, because the tests are unchanged and only
#: one test per job pays this: per-slice Σ `call` fell by a median of 37.4s
#: (mean 37.6s) across all thirteen, i.e. 70 − 37 = 33. The three single-test
#: slices give it directly as `call − recorded cost`: 34.0s (`benchmark-ab`),
#: 40.4s (`benchmark-replay`), 22.5s (`remote-assist`). And the resulting model
#: predicts the measured critical path to within 0.14 min.
IMAGE_BUILD_SECONDS = 33.0

#: Every e2e test, the slice that owns it, and its *warm* pytest `call` duration
#: in seconds — the median over seven runs of the invocations where the project
#: image already existed. Warm is the right unit because IMAGE_BUILD_SECONDS is
#: charged once per job on top; balancing warm costs balances wall clock.
#:
#: `derived` marks the three tests that have only ever run first in their job,
#: so their warm cost is the measured value minus IMAGE_BUILD_SECONDS. That
#: arithmetic is not a guess any more: #226 recorded five derived costs, #235's
#: rebalance moved two of them out of first position, and both came back within
#: 3s of the derivation (`link-latency` 146.9 derived / 145.0 measured,
#: `independent...in_parallel` 143.9 / 146.6).
#:
#: To refresh: every e2e invocation runs `--durations=0`, so a merge-gate run
#: prints every number here, and each slice's first test prints one more
#: measurement of IMAGE_BUILD_SECONDS. See docs/ci.md, "Balancing the e2e
#: slices".
