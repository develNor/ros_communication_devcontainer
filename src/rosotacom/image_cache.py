"""Content-addressed names for the images this project builds.

Every e2e job used to rebuild the same project image from scratch, and #236
measured what that cost: 154s per job across the thirteen jobs in that run.
Publishing the built image once and adopting it in each job removes the build —
but only if "adopt" can never mean "adopt something else". A cached image that
no longer matches its build inputs is a silent wrong-result machine, which is why #226
declined to do this inline.

So the name of a published image is a hash of everything that determines it:
the ``docker build`` command ros2docker renders from a config, and the build
context it stages. Nothing else decides what the image contains. A changed base
digest, apt package, pip package, Dockerfile, entrypoint, or ros2docker version
is a different hash and therefore a different name, so "the published image is
stale" is not a state this can be in rather than a state it is unlikely to be
in. A consumer never receives a reference to trust; it derives the one name its
own inputs allow and pulls exactly that.

The image name itself is deliberately excluded from the hash. It says what the
caller wants the result called, not what is in it, and rosotacom scopes it per
install (``ros-communication-<install_id>``), so including it would give two
checkouts of the same tree two different hashes for one image.
