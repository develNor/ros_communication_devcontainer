"""Lightweight link-byte measurement from the kernel's own interface counters.

The OTA link runs over a (typically dedicated) network interface -- a VPN tunnel
such as ``tun1`` in the cross-host setup. The kernel already counts every byte
that crosses it in ``/proc/net/dev`` (``rx_bytes`` / ``tx_bytes``), so measuring
link traffic needs no packet capture, no ``tshark``, and no privileges: we read
two counters, diff them over a window, and divide by elapsed time.

This replaces the ``sudo tshark`` path in ``topic_monitor`` (see RFC 0002
"link overhead"): the status overview already measures the *ROS payload*
bandwidth per stage, and this module supplies the *wire* bandwidth, so the two
together give the overhead ratio ``link / payload`` (=~1 healthy; >>1 means
retransmits, shadow connections, or a bad RMW/QoS).

Pure parsing is split out (``parse_proc_net_dev``) so it is unit-testable against
a fixture without touching the real filesystem.
