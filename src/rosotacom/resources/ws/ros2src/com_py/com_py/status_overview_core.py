# \brief  Pure (ROS-independent) logic for the rosotacom status overview.
#
# This module holds the per-stage observation accumulator, the stage/topic
# classification, the rollup ("where is the topic now?") and the artifact
# rendering. It deliberately has no rclpy dependency so it can be unit-tested
# on the host. status_overview.py wires it to live ROS observers.

    Only outbound topics: their stages are produced on this machine. Inbound
    stages depend on the peer and the link, which the per-topic rollup already
    diagnoses.

    Only the *first* absent stage per topic, because the ones behind it are
    absent for the trivial reason that nothing reached them, and reporting a
    cascade as four findings buries the one that matters.

    `owner` is what makes the finding actionable, and it takes three values that
    look identical in the graph:

    * ``rosotacom`` -- a stage this peer starts itself, whose input is arriving.
      It had something to forward and forwarded nothing. This is the defect.
    * ``application`` -- the native stage of a topic the user's application (or a
      replay) publishes. Not this peer's promise.
    * ``upstream`` -- a stage this peer starts whose input has not delivered a
      message yet. Its publisher appears on discovery of the input, so there is
      nothing wrong: `universal_ota_wrapper` has no `…/ota_stamped` publisher
      until something publishes the topic it wraps.

    This exists because of a failure that produced no error anywhere. On
    2026-08-13 the centre's `heartbeat_echo` and one `topic_monitor` died two
    seconds after start -- Cyclone had no free participant index left on the
    local domain -- and catmux left both panes sitting at a shell prompt. The
    session ran for two hours with no heartbeat publisher, so the run has no RTT
    and no clock-offset measurement, and the far side reported `status=LOST
    reason=age hz=0.00` about a peer that was otherwise healthy. The heartbeat is
    the one outbound topic rosotacom publishes itself, which is why the

    Zero is unambiguous and was the only case handled before. It is also the

    first tens of messages of a fresh publisher are written before the reader
    has matched. In the 2026-08-13 field instance the peer restarted four times
    and the first arrival after each restart carried seq 37, 39, 39 and 41 --
    never 0. Every one of them was therefore counted as `reordered`, and
    because the baseline was never reset, so was every message after it: 26,453
    of 55,437 transits on one 10 Hz topic, for the rest of the instance.

    So a large backward jump counts as a restart too. It is corroborated by an
    arrival gap (105 s, 32 s, 44 s and 195 s in that instance), but the gap is
