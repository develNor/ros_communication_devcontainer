"""The packaged image profile must install every ROS package the sessions invoke.

The session templates emit concrete commands — `ros2 run topic_tools throttle`,
`ros2 run domain_bridge domain_bridge`, and so on. If the packaged image profile
does not install the package behind one of them, the stage dies with
"Package '<name>' not found" and the pipeline stops there.

That failure is quiet where it matters. The producing side reports the topic as
present at its native stage; only the *next* stage is missing, so a receiver
simply never sees the processed topic and waits for something that will never
arrive. Reviewing a diff does not catch it, because the command and the package
list live in different files and neither mentions the other.

So the coupling is asserted here instead of trusted: every package name the
session templates run has to appear in the profile that builds the image those
templates run in.
