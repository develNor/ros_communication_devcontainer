"""Header-only packet capture of the OTA link, beside the link trace.

Runs inside the communication container for the lifetime of one peer, started
by `status_overview` when a session definition asks for it:

    shared:
      use_status_overview: true
      ota_pcap:
        enabled: true

    python3 -m com_py.ota_pcap --iface tun0 --out .../ota.pcap [--peer 10.254.0.37]

WHAT IT ANSWERS THAT `link_trace.jsonl` CANNOT
----------------------------------------------
The link trace counts `/proc/net/dev` bytes per direction once a second, which
localises loss to a *direction* and no further. It cannot say which fragment of
which sample was lost, whether a retransmit followed, or how one sample's
sub-messages were spaced on the wire. Those are the questions a header-only
capture answers, at roughly 1 % of payload volume.

It is passive and local: nothing is transmitted, so it costs no link capacity,
and the interface is never put into promiscuous mode — everything of interest
is addressed to or from this host, and promiscuous mode on a control-centre LAN
port would collect other people's traffic. `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, which the
originating issue assumed was needed, buys only that.

WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT NEXT TO A RECORDER
--------------------------------------------
The first implementation of this sat beside the recording tool in the
downstream project, and had to rebuild what this container already knows:
which interface carries the link, and to which peer. `link_bytes` answers both
from the peer's own OTA address — including the refusal that matters most, a
loopback interface for a non-loopback address, which once read 28 Gbit/s next
to a 6 Mbit/s link and survived a field session (#267). A capture that has to
re-derive link knowledge is in the wrong place; this one asks the same
resolution the status snapshot's own link block uses.

WHAT IT NEEDS, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED
-------------------------------------------
`sudo`, and only until the socket is open. ros2docker's entrypoint runs this
container's processes as `containeruser`, whose `CapEff` is
0000000000000000 — a non-root process cannot open an `AF_PACKET` socket
however the container was started, so `--cap-add` buys nothing. `containeruser`
does have passwordless sudo here, which the NET pane's `sudo iftop` already
relies on, so the capture is launched through it and `--drop-to` hands the
process back to `containeruser` the moment the socket exists. The pcap in
`logs/<peer>/status/` therefore belongs to the same user as `link_trace.jsonl`
beside it.

That is the whole cost: no image change, no rebuild, no added capability and no
extra container. Two earlier attempts at this assumed root from a `docker run`
that bypassed the entrypoint, and both were wrong in the same way — check the
*running* container, not the image.

THE FILE
--------
`SOCK_DGRAM` rather than `SOCK_RAW`, which is what makes one code path work on
both link types the fleet uses: a VPN `tun` device is layer 3 and has no
link-layer header at all, while a LAN port is Ethernet. The kernel hands a
`SOCK_DGRAM` packet socket the network-layer packet either way, plus the
`sockaddr_ll` that says what the link layer was.

That is exactly the input `LINKTYPE_LINUX_SLL` (113) is defined over, so the
16-byte SLL pseudo-header is synthesized from the address tuple and the file
reads in Wireshark, tshark and scapy without a hint. It carries the field the
analysis is actually for: `pkttype` distinguishes PACKET_OUTGOING from
PACKET_HOST, so **every packet in the file is labelled uplink or downlink** —
which is the direction question the per-second counters answer only coarsely,
and the one a direction-blind `LINKTYPE_RAW` capture would have thrown away.

Timestamps come from the kernel (`SO_TIMESTAMPNS`), not from the moment python
got round to the packet, and are written at microsecond resolution — the
classic `0xa1b2c3d4` magic, because every reader takes it and a millisecond
phenomenon does not need nanoseconds.

HONESTY ABOUT WHAT IT MISSED
----------------------------
A capture that quietly drops packets is worse than none: the analysis would
read the gap as radio loss. So `PACKET_STATISTICS` is read from the kernel and
the sidecar `.json` reports `kernel_drops` next to `packets`. A non-zero drop
count means this process fell behind, not that the link did.
