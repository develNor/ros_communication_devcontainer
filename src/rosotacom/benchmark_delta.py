"""Compare two benchmark result sets taken in different environments.

The local emulated lanes encode most of the performance truth cheaply and
deterministically. What they cannot show is **which effects exist only on the
real link** — cellular variability, VPN/MTU quirks, radio behaviour, real
cross-traffic — and which are emulation artifacts. Real links stay monitor-only
by the determinism rule, so the missing piece was never another measurement: it
was the *comparison* between two sets of the same rows.

This is that comparison. It reads two directories (or lists) of `result.json`
runs, pairs them by what makes a row a row, and reports per-row, per-metric
deltas as JSON plus a short Markdown summary.

Three properties are deliberate, because it is easy to produce numbers that lie:

* **Pairing is explicit and refuses to guess.** Rows are matched on genre,
  profile, RMW and session name. A row present on one side only is reported as
  unmatched rather than silently dropped, because "it got faster" and "it did
  not run" must not look the same.
* **Every report says it is correlational.** The two sets differ in the
  environment *and* in everything the environment drags along; a delta is an
  observation, never a verdict. `monitor_only: true` is in the JSON and the
  first line of the Markdown.
* **It is self-describing.** Each side carries its rosotacom SHA, profile file,
  and the command that produced it, so a report pasted into a paper or an issue
  can be traced back without the directory it came from.
